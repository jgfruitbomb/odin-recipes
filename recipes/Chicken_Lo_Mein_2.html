    <p>Chicken lo mein great asian dish with savory noodles tossed in sauce</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Stir Fry</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 boneless chicken breast</li>
      <li>Salt/Pepper</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons peanut oil</li>
      <li>1/4 cup dry white wine</li>
      <li>2 1/2 cups mixed stir fry vegetables</li>
      <li>10 oz. lo mein noodles</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Sauce</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup chicken broth</li>
      <li>3/4 cup beef broth</li>
      <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
      <li>2 tablespoon constarch</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon hot sauce</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon tasted sesame oil</li>
      <li>1/4 tsp ground ginger</li>
      <li>1 pinch red pepper flakes</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Once all ingredients are measured and ready, heat oil in a large skillet
        over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and let it sear, undisturbed, for
        about 3 minutes. Toss and allow the other sides to cook through and turn
        golden, about 2-3 more minutes. Remove and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        dd the wine to the same skillet that you used to cook the chicken over
        medium heat. Use a silicone spatula to “clean” the bottom and sides of
        the skillet, this will add flavor to the sauce. Let it bubble and reduce
        by half, about 2 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the lo mein noodles to the boiling water. Boil them for 1 minute
        less than al dente according to package instructions. (Set a timer to
        ensure you don’t overcook it.) Drain once cooked.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the noodles cook, add the vegetables to the skillet (and a little
        more oil if needed) and cook for about 3 minutes to soften slightly. Add
        the sauce and bring it to a boil, then reduce heat to low.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use kitchen tongs to add the cooked lo mein a bit at a time, until
        desired noodle-to-sauce- ratio is obtained. (I use about 8 oz. instead
        of 10 oz.) Important: The noodles will continue to absorb the sauce and
        the flavors will continue to meld as it stands.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the chicken back to the skillet and toss to coat. Heat through for
        1-2 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Garnish with your favorite toppings (see notes for suggestions) and
        serve!
      </li>
    </ol>
